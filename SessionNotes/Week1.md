    - Attendance is monitored but is completely optional
    - Each session will include a brief overview of various modules as well as structured code practice
1. Recap: Principles of Programming
    - C
    - Haskell
1. Recap: Discrete Maths for CS
1. Support: Engineering Challenges/ Design & Professional Skills
1. Programming exercises


## Programming Exercises: Sorting algorithms and asymptotic analysis

1. Write a function that merges two sorted arrays ```a``` and ```b```.
1. In an array of integers, a "peak" is an element which is greater than or equal to the adjacent integers and a "valley" is an element which is less than or equal to the adjacent integers. Write a function that sorts an integer array into an alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.


```python
# Q1
def merge_two_sorted_arrays(a: list[int], b: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    pass


# Q2
def sort_into_peaks_and_valleys(array: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    pass
```
